Unlike their high-end produce, their website is in need of a tune up. I focused on redesigning their homepage since it is the most heavily trafficked page and carries the most weight in creating a first impression.

View <a href=\"https://peaceful-caverns-98735.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> the final website</a> and see the <a href=\"https://github.com/kfriis33/wilson_farm_redesign\">source code</a>!\n              </p>\n\n              <h2>Learnings & Takeaways</h2>\n              <p>From this project, I learned a lot more about web development with HTML and CSS and making pages responsive. I experimented with flex boxes and CSS grids, but for relatively small grids found that I liked CSS grids better because you can control exactly how the page responds at different sizes. I also found that designing with simplicity at the forefront goes a long way in improving the usability of the website, as well as stepping into the users' shoes to imagine the important destinations or information they would be seeking to find on the website. </p>\n            </div>\n          );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default

start-up <a href=\"https://carbonchain.io/\">Carbon Chain</a>. Throughout our design process, we never looked at Carbon Chain's website or product and based our design off of the loose premise of their start up: software to help companies––mostly gas and oil companies, \n                  regulators, and carbon traders––estimate and track the carbon emissions of their supply chains.\n\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  We decided to design the main product’s interface for a \n                  user to view their company's emissions and supply chains. We imagined that our users would each have custom needs \n                  in terms of what data was most important to them. Companies or regulators are dealing with vast \n                  amounts of data and ever changing regulations, so we wanted our interface to be customizable, \n                  simple, and insightful.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <h2>Design Process</h2>\n              <div>\n                <h3>Sketches</h3>\n                <p>We began by brainstorming multiple ideas for the design of the website. To get the greatest diversity of ideas, we first each brainstormed individually and made a sketch for how we thought the design could look. We then looked at all three sketches together and mixed and matched different ideas to come up with a fourth sketch.</p>\n\n\n                <div className=\"row mx-2\">\n                  <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <h5>Sketch 1</h5>\n                    <Carousel interval={null} className=\"sketch-container\">\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Dashboard</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch1Dashboard} className=\"sketch-1\" /> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Supply chains</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch1Chain} className=\"sketch-1\" /> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Add new chain</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch1Add} className=\"sketch-1\" /> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Account</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch1Account} className=\"sketch-1\" />\n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                    </Carousel>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <h5>Sketch 2</h5>\n                    <Carousel interval={null} className=\"sketch-container\">\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Dashboard</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch2Dashboard}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Supply chains</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch2Add}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                  \n                    </Carousel>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"row mt-3 mx-2\">\n                  <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <h5>Sketch 3</h5>\n                    <Carousel interval={null} className=\"sketch-container\">\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Dashboard</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch3Dashboard}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Supply chains</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch3Chain}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Account</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch3Account} />\n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                    </Carousel>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n                    <h5>Sketch 4</h5>\n                    <Carousel interval={null} className=\"sketch-container\">\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Dashboard</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch4Dashboard}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Supply chains</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch4Chain}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                      <Carousel.Item>\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                          <p>Add new chain</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                        <img src={Sketch4Add}/> \n                      </Carousel.Item>\n                    </Carousel>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <h3>Wireframes</h3>\n                <p>Next we created a wireframe for our design based off of our four sketches.

In converting over our wireframes, we focused on using color to highlight key information while maintaining a pleasant and cohesive color scheme that would be pleasant to look at. We also added in more details to each page, and added interactive hovers and elements to make the prototype more dynamic. </p>\n                <h4>Crit Feedback</h4>\n                <p>After our first iteration of our high fidelity prototype, we participated in a critique with around 10 other students and a professional UI/UX designer.

Two users indicated that they thought clicking on the drop down menu on “All Chains” on the dashboard would take them to the supply chain.

First, hearing verbal feedback during our crit was valuable in seeing what others thought from a more high-level pass of our website. A lot of what we heard back was about the visual style and overall aesthetic. From user testing, being able to watch how someone used the prototype and tried to navigate through it was extremely interesting, especially since I had never done any sort of formal user testing with strangers before. I found this feedback to be extremely authentic and insgihtful into the usability strenghths and weakenesses of the prototype, and I definitley plan to use this technique again in the future to test my designs!</p>\n            </div>\n          );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default IterativeDesign;\n\n",["90","91"],"/Users/katiefriis/Documents/course/cs1300/portfolio/src/projects/quarantine-cards/QuarantineCards.jsx",["92"],"import React, {Component} from 'react'\n\nimport AppScreenshot from \"./screenshot.png\"\n\n\nclass QuarantineCards extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>     \n                <h2>Overview</h2>\n                <p>While quarantining from COVID-19, have you ever found yourself at a loss for what to do?

One challenge I faced was trying to make the card grid and the \"My Day\" aggregator section clearly seperate sections while still making them cohesive as side by side sections on the page. To achieve this, I made the aggregator starting height as the same as the first row of the grid to make it visually blend in more, but I gave it a different background color and added more horizontal spacing between it and the grid. Once cards were added to aggregator, I removed the icon so they would take up less vertical space, and changed the background color to make them more distinguishable from the grid. The color I changed them to was the same color as the dropdown buttons for the gird for some more cohesiveness.\n                </p>\n                <p> More generally, I designed with clear text hierarchies and simple, consistent color palettes. I used color to make important elements like the buttons stand out by making them more vibrant. I made the cards as consistent as possible, such as making sure they were the same total height and forcing the icons to be the same height so that all the titles were in same line with each other. \n                </p>\n                \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                <h2>Final Application & Code</h2>\n                <p> Check out the <a href=\"https://salty-beyond-44732.herokuapp.com/\">final web application</a> and the project's <a href=\"https://github.com/kfriis33/quarantine-cards\">source code on GitHub</a>!</p>\n                \n                <h2>Learnings & Takeaways</h2>\n                <p>I learned a lot of technical skills from working on this project. As my first real deep dive into React.js (and also Javascript actually), I was introduced to all things React: components, props, state, just to name a few. More generally, I learned the importance of organizing the various components and call back functions in a deliberate way (I learned the hard way that things can get messy very fast). Finally, as someone who would actually use this application, I had a lot of fun thinking about the user experience and stepping into the shoes of the user and designing for them!</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default QuarantineCards;","/Users/katiefriis/Documents/course/cs1300/portfolio/src/projects/techno-optimism/TechnoOptimism.jsx",["93","94","95"],"import React, {Component} from 'react'\nimport TechnoGif from './techno.gif'\n\nclass TechnoOptimism extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div> \n                <i>Note: this project is still being worked on and is not yet in its final form :)</i>\n                <h2>Overview</h2>\n                <p>\n                    Can technology save the world? Can algorithms solve all our problems? At times in my life, I have believed the answer to these questions to be close to \"yes\". For awhile, all the tech companies and projects I read and heard about seemed amazing: computer models to understand diseases, algorithms to personalize education, AI to predict the results of an election. Technology could do anything, and we had only scraped the tip of what was possible.\n                </p> <p>  \n                    Senior year of college, I took a seminar called <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/2952v/\">\"Algorithms for the People\"</a>, which examined the societal impacts of technology. In our very first reading, I learned the name for these beliefs I'd had: techno-optimism, the notion that technology can continually be improved and can continually improve people’s lives and make the world a better place. From class readings and discussions throughout the semester, this notion was repeatedly debunked as we saw example after example of technologies that did more harm than good despite their “for good” framing to the public. For our final project, a friend and I were interested in exploring these trends more formally, but initially we weren't sure exactly how. \n                </p>\n                <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>How can trends of techno-optimism be quantified and communicated to the public?</li>\n                    <li>How do the ways companies describe themselves differ from their true impact?</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <h3>Project Summary</h3>\n                <p>These questions led us to focusing on the written language that pushes forward overly positive views of technology. We brainstormed various text-based data sources that might have this agenda such as company mission statements and websites, and then brainstormed text-based data sources that might provide contrast such as news articles, court cases, and academia. We created datasets for ourselves using web scraping, then used natural language processing to analyze them to find the most commonly used words, the most common verbs and adjectives, and the sentiment rating of the text as a whole. Finally, we made data visualizations of these results and displayed them on a public website. By quantifying the trends of language used by different technology stakeholders and creating visualizations of them, we sought to reveal the fluff that’s used to make technology seem like an entirely positive, world-changing good and display the dissonance between this language and technology’s true impact.</p>\n                <div className=\"content-card\">\n                <img src={TechnoGif} alt=\"Screenshot recording of website\" width=\"500px\" />\n                </div>\n\n                <h2>Final Application & Code</h2>\n                <p> Check out the <a href=\"\">final web application</a> and the project's <a href=\"\">source code on GitHub</a>!</p>\n\n                <h2>Learnings & Takeaways</h2>\n                <p>A major challenge of this project was actually determining what the project should be. Since we started completely from scratch, picking the direction we wanted to go and the goals we wanted to achieve was not easy. From there, deciding on more specific details such as data sources and types of visualizations felt overwhelming, especially given how exploratory the project as a whole was. In the end, I think an important lesson learned was just getting started. Although some planning is definiltey helpful and important, exploring without a completely concrete direction and trying things out experimentally is definitley better than staying stuck in the brainstorming phase.</p>\n          \n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default TechnoOptimism;","/Users/katiefriis/Documents/course/cs1300/portfolio/src/projects/QuarantineCards.jsx",["96","97","98"],"import React, {Component} from 'react'\nimport IconButton from '@material-ui/core/IconButton';\nimport CancelIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Cancel';\n\nclass QuarantineCards extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>     \n                <div className=\"row align-items-end justify-content-between\">\n                <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n                  <h3><i>Learning React</i></h3>\n                  <h1>Quarantine Cards</h1>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <hr></hr>\n                <h3>Overview & Goals</h3>\n                <p>This web appplication aims to help users find things to do while in quarantine from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hopefully, this application can help users combat boredom and make it easier for them to find healthy and safe things to do with their time!\n                </p>\n\n                <div class=\"card\">\n                <figure class=\"screenshot\" >\n                    <img class=\"screenshot-img\"src=\"images/screenshot.png\" alt=\"screenshot of the application\"/>\n                    <figcaption>Screenshot of final web application.</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                <h3>Usability Considerations</h3>\n                <p>In designing the visual interface of this application, I wanted to make it as simple, easy-to-use, and visually appealing as possible. One challenge I faced was trying to make the card grid and the \"My Day\" aggregator section clearly seperate sections while still making them cohesive as side by side sections on the page. To achieve this, I made the aggregator starting height as the same as the first row of the grid to make it visually blend in more, but I mgave it a different background color and added more horizontal spacing between it and the grid. Once cards were added to aggregator, I removed the icon so they would take up less vertical space, and changed the background color to make them more distinguishable from the grid. The color I changed them to was the same color as the dropdown buttons for the gird for some more cohesiveness.\n                </p>\n                <p> More generally, I kept visual design principles such as clear text hierarchies and simple, consistent color palettes at the forefront of my design. I used color to make important elements like the buttons stand out by making them more vibrant. I made the cards as consistent as possible, such as making sure they were the same total height and forcing the icons to be the same height so that all the titles were in same line with each other. \n
