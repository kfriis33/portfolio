View <a href=\"https://peaceful-caverns-98735.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> the final website</a> and see the <a href=\"https://github.com/kfriis33/wilson_farm_redesign\">source code</a>!\n              </p>\n\n              <h2>Learnings & Takeaways</h2>\n              <p>From this project, I learned a lot more about web development with HTML and CSS and making pages responsive. I experimented with flex boxes and CSS grids, but for relatively small grids found that I liked CSS grids better because you can control exactly how the page responds at different sizes. I also found that designing with simplicity at the forefront goes a long way in improving the usability of the website, as well as stepping into the users' shoes to imagine the important destinations or information they would be seeking to find on the website. </p>\n            </div>\n          );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default

One challenge I faced was trying to make the card grid and the \"My Day\" aggregator section clearly seperate sections while still making them cohesive as side by side sections on the page. To achieve this, I made the aggregator starting height as the same as the first row of the grid to make it visually blend in more, but I mgave it a different background color and added more horizontal spacing between it and the grid. Once cards were added to aggregator, I removed the icon so they would take up less vertical space, and changed the background color to make them more distinguishable from the grid.

I used color to make important elements like the buttons stand out by making them more vibrant. I made the cards as consistent as possible, such as making sure they were the same total height and forcing the icons to be the same height so that all the titles were in same line with each other. \n                </p>\n                \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                <h2>Final Application & Code</h2>\n                <p> Check out the <a href=\"https://salty-beyond-44732.herokuapp.com/\">final web application</a> and the project's <a href=\"https://github.com/kfriis33/quarantine-cards\">source code on GitHub</a>!</p>\n                \n                <h2>Learnings & Takeaways</h2>\n                <p>I learned a lot of technical skills from working on this project.

More generally, I learned the importance of organizing the various components and call back functions in a deliberate way (I learned the hard way that things can get messy very fast).

We were interested in exploring and visualizing the trend of techno-optimism, the notion that technology can continually be improved and can continually improve people’s lives and make the world a better place. From class readings and discussions throughout the semester, this notion was repeatedly debunked as we saw example after example of technologies that did more harm than good despite their “for good” framing to the public. We were interested in exploring these trends more formally, but initially we were not sure exactly how. \n                </p>\n                <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>How can trends of techno-optimism be quantified and communicated to the public?</li>\n                    <li>How do the ways companies describe themselves differ from their true impact?</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <h3>Project Summary</h3>\n                <p>These questions led us to focusing on the written language that pushes forward overly positive views of technology. We brainstormed various text-based data sources that might have this agenda such as company mission statements and websites, and then brainstormed text-based data sources that might provide contrast such as news articles, court cases, and academia. We created datasets for ourselves using web scraping, then used natural language processing to analyze them to find the most commonly used words, the most common verbs and adjectives, and the sentiment rating of the text as a whole. Finally, we made data visualizations of these results and displayed them on a public website. By quantifying the trends of language used by different technology stakeholders and creating visualizations of them, we sought to reveal the fluff that’s used to make technology seem like an entirely positive, world-changing good and display the dissonance between this language and technology’s true impact.</p>\n                <div className=\"content-card\">\n                <img src={TechnoGif} alt=\"Screenshot recording of website\" width=\"500px\" />\n                </div>\n\n                <h2>Final Application & Code</h2>\n                <p> Check out the <a href=\"\">final web application</a> and the project's <a href=\"\">source code on GitHub</a>!</p>\n\n                <h2>Learnings & Takeaways</h2>\n                <p>A major challenge of this project was actually determining what the project should be. Since we started completely from scratch, picking the direction we wanted to go and the goals we wanted to achieve was not easy. From there, deciding on more specific details such as data sources and types of visualizations felt overwhelming, especially given how exploratory the project as a whole was. In the end, I think an important lesson learned was just getting started. Although some planning is definiltey helpful and important, exploring without a completely concrete direction and trying things out experimentally is definitley better than staying stuck in the brainstorming phase.</p>\n          \n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default TechnoOptimism;","/Users/katiefriis/Documents/course/cs1300/portfolio/src/projects/QuarantineCards.jsx",["98","99","100"],"import React, {Component} from 'react'\nimport IconButton from '@material-ui/core/IconButton';\nimport CancelIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Cancel';\n\nclass QuarantineCards extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>     \n                <div className=\"row align-items-end justify-content-between\">\n                <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n                  <h3><i>Learning React</i></h3>\n                  <h1>Quarantine Cards</h1>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <hr></hr>\n                <h3>Overview & Goals</h3>\n                <p>This web appplication aims to help users find things to do while in quarantine from the COVID-19 pandemic.
